# Comparatives and Superlatives

## Comparatives

"More" is translated to "lebih".  
Adjectives are then put right after.

|Dia **lebih tinggi** |He/she is **taller**| 
|Dia **lebih tua** |He/she is **older**| 
|Dia **lebih kuat** |He/she is **stronger**| 
|Dia **lebih cepat** |He/she is **faster**| 

:::tip Kurang / kalah
While **"kurang"** means **"less"**, it focuses more on the negative i.e. "kurang tinggi" means "not as tall"

## Superlatives

**"Most + adj"** is translated to **"paling + adj "**  
but there's also the option of adding the prefix **ter-** to do the same  
e.g. **paling tinggi** or **tertinggi** means **the tallest**
