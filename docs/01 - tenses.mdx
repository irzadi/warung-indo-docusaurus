# To be, Tenses and Word Order

## To be

**To be** is almost never used in Indonesian. Formally, the word "*adalah*" is used for "to be" . However it does not carry any information with it (tenses, gender or active/passive voice) it has become redundant and are often omitted.

In summary: for colloquial Indonesian **simply combine noun with with another noun or adjective**


|ID          |EN            |note|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Dia **adalah** temanku |He/she **is** my friend| sounds strange to native speaker
|Dia temanku |He/she **is** my friend|  sounds much better

:::tip Filler Words
There are places where it sounds better if we use filler words inbetween. See below
:::


|ID          |EN            |note|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Dia **adalah** polisi |He/she **is** a policeman| sounds strange to native speaker
|Dia **tuh** polisi |He/she **is** a police|  **tuh** is a filler word, it has no meaning
|Sekolah **ini** bagus |**This** school is good | **ini** is filler word, now the sentence flows better|


:::tip ada di
A common place to actually use **adalah** is when we want to indicate a person's location. We use a contracted version **"ada di"** which means "is in/at/on ..."
:::


|ID          |EN            |note|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Dia **ada** di rumah |He/she **is** at home| *ada* is abbr. from *adalah*
|Dia **ada** di sini? |**Is** he here?| in Indonesia only the context and rising tone at the end indicates it's a question

:::warning Using **adalah** with adjectives
*Adalah* **cannot** be used at all to join noun with adjective
:::

|ID                |                         EN |                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Sekolah bagus         |The school is good |correct but sounds stitled
|Sekolah ini bagus         |The school is good|correct and flows nicely
|Sekolah ini **adalah** bagus  |The school is good|**incorrect**

## Tenses


Given that we cannot use "*adalah*" nor is there verb-conjugation that signals tenses in Indonesian, we simply add **time markers** to our sentence instead. We'll discuss this in much more detail in the next chapter but you might surmise for the examples below that memorizing some time markers will enable you to translate most tenses to Indonesian.


|ID          |EN            |note|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Dia **sedang** makan ayam goreng|He/she **is eating** fried chicken|
|Dia **akan** makan ayam goreng|He/she **will eat** fried chicken|
|Dia **sudah** makan ayam goreng|He/she **has eaten** fried chicken|
|Dia **tadi** makan ayam goreng|He/she **ate** eating fried chicken|
|Dia **tadi sedang** makan ayam goreng|He/she **was eating** fried chicken|


## Word Order

Indonesian word order is very similar to English. *Subject* comes first, followed by *verb* and then rest of the sentence.

|                |                          |                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|**Saya**|**tinggal**            |**di Jakarta**            |
|I          |live            |in Jakarta|

Major difference in word order is that adjectives come after the noun it modifies.

|                |                          |                         |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|**Baju**|**merah**            |Noun + adj|
|Red          |shirt            |Adj + Noun|
