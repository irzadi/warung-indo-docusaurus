# Welcome to Warung Indonesia!

Hi! I'm Zadi, your resident Indonesian in **Warung Indonesia**. If you want to learn the Indonesian Language and there are things that you are confused about then I am here to help. I hang out a Discord server for learners of Indonesian Languange which is also often populated by native speakers wanting to learn English.

If you have any suggestion, question or request for things to add on the website, feel free to contact me over at the Discord server which you can find the link below:

Without further ado, let's start with:

## Forms of Address

Due to Indonesia's strong social hierarchy there are many forms of address which often carry certain class connotation when used. Luckily, foreigners are largely exempt from the expectation of using the correct form of address so don't sweat it too much. If you picked the wrong form of address and the situation calls for it, someone will probably discreetly try to advise you to use the correct one.

All that said, knowing the correct second person pronoun to use is the most important part of Indonesian pronouns so above all else we'll start with it.

### Anda
**Anda** means "*you*".
It carries a neutral but respectful tone. You can't really go wrong when using it unless you are a native Indonesian yourself. (where it can be considered too formal and stiff by some)

### Kamu, engkau dan kau

**Kamu** and **kau** (abbreviated form of **engkau**) also means *you* but carries a familiar and/or informal sense. You can use it to address children, younger family members or close friends but **do not** use it to address other adult. Kamu and engkau are used by social superiors to address their inferiors. They are also used sometimes by older people to address younger people with whom they already have a very good relationship with. Therefore when it doubt. Don't use **kamu** except with close friends and dont use **engkau** at all.

Now that might seem confusing, if **Anda** is neutral and **Kamu** is too familiar then how does one address other adult?

### Bapak

**Bapak** or **pak** (literally means *father*) is one you can use in almost any situation to address other male adult. Often used preceeding their first name e.g. to address one called *Agus Hermawan* you'd say *pak Agus*. Family name is *almost never used* to address people in Indonesia.

### Ibu

**Ibu** or **bu** (literally means *mother*) is similar to the above, but used to address female adult. E.g. The Indonesian Finance minister is Sri Mulyani Indrawati. You could address her with "*Ibu Sri Mulyani*"

### Mas

**Mas** (literally *older brother*) is a polite way to address male young adult. It has a slight connotation of addressing a social inferior. So if unsure  simply use **pak** instead. 

### Kak
**Kak** which is the abbreviated from of *kakak*, literally means *older sibling*. In recent times it has become the preferred way to address adult stranger on, both male and female, online. This carries an informal but respectful tone.

### Mbak 
**Mbak** is often used in Java to address female but it carries a stronger sense of addressing social inferiors. I.e. use it to address waitresses and such but do not use this when you are in doubt of their social standing compared to you.


:::tip Addressing others
You should know enough second person pronouns by now to "survive". When in doubt use **anda** to address younger person otherwise use **bapak** and **ibu**.

:::caution Take care though!
As you delve further it will get more complicated that this. For example physicians expect to be addressed as "pak dokter" or "bu dokter". 
People with high position in the government will expect to be addressed as such i.e. **Pak presiden**, **Bu Gubernur** and so on.

    <ul>
        <li>I = gue</li>
        <li>We = kami / kita</li>
        <li>You = kamu, loe</li>

    </ul>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>


### Singular first person = I or me
**Saya** is formal but can be used in pretty much any situation. I use to to refer to myself when speaking to relatives or even to my girlfriend. Use it when in doubt.

**Aku** carries a more informal tone and seldom used by native Indonesians (at least by those who live in Java). I hear it in movies much more often than in real life. Supposedly more commonly used in other parts of Indonesia.

**Gue** (from the Hokkien "goa") is used only among close friends or young people in informal setting. I'd only use it if the person you are addressing started using it first. Can also be used when one party is of much higher social standing than the other.

### First person plural  = we or us

Interestingly **kita** includes the person being addressed. On the contrary **kami** excludes the person being addressed.
For simplicity's sake or when in doubt you can simply use **kita** and let the other person decides for himself whether to include himself in the pronoun.

### Second person singular  = you

As noted in the previous section,  this is where Indonesian can get really complex but luckily foreigners aren't expected to always use the correct form of address. Refer to the previous section for more details. I put it in the very first part of the document as for Indonesians, these are the most important pronouns to use correctly.

### Second person plural = you

In formal setting use **bapak bapak** or **ibu ibu**. 
You are introduced to the way Indonesian form plural nouns which is simply to repeat the word. So to say "*Ladies and Gentlemen*" you'd say " *Bapak bapak dan ibu ibu"*. As always, in Indonesia, males get to go first :-)

In settings where predominantly young adults are addressed then use "**Saudara saudara**" which means (*siblings*). Carries more informal tone so it is often used to address the congregation in religious rituals in churches or mosques.

**Kalian** is seldom used by Indonesians. Carries a strong connotation of addressing social inferiors. It's actually more polite to eliminate it altogether, for example:

 - When trying to ask "Where are you going?"
 - Instead of : "*Kalian mau pergi kemana* ?"
 - Better to say "*Mau pergi kemana* ?"

### Third Person

Luckily social hierarchy plays a small role when referring to a third person so using **dia** for *he/she* and **mereka** for *they* is pretty safe in almost any situation.
