# Forming Question Sentences

In Indonesian colloquially forming interrogative sentences are often done simply by having a rising intonation at the end.

|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Dia temanmu |He/she **is** your friend| flat intonation
|Dia temanmu ? |**Is** he/she your friend ?|  rising intonation at the end


:::tip Apa
In more formal setting, we usually use the question word **Apa** i.e. *what* to create question sentences
:::

Since colloquial Indonesian merely uses rising intonation at the end of a
sentence to indicate a question, it often creates ambiguity even for native speakers.

Therefore a recent trend in Indonesian language is adding the suffix **-kah** 
which is contracted from **"apakah"** to create interrogative sentences. 
Using it will eliminate the aforementioned ambiguity.

|**Apakah** dia temanmu |Is he/she your friend?| Formal
|**Apa** dia temanmu |Is he/she your friend?| less formal 
|Dia temanmu ? |Is he/she your friend ?|  informal
|Dia temanmu **kah**? |Is he/she your friend ?|  recent trend, formal but shorter


## Question Words

|ID          |EN            |note|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|**Apakah** dia temanmu ?|Is he/she your friend?| yes/no question
|**Dimana** temanmu ?|**Where** is your friend?|  
|**Siapa** temanmu ?|**Who** is your friend?|  
|**Kenapa** temanmu sakit?|**Why** is your friend sick?|  
|**Kapan** temanmu akan datang?|**When** will your friend come?|  
|**Bagaimana** temanmu akan datang kesini?|**How** will your friend come here?|  
|**Apa** masalahmu ?|**What** is your problem?| 

As you can see, forming a yes/no question can be very similar to using the "what" question word.
Go ahead and learn more examples below to see the difference.

|ID          |EN            |note|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|**Apa(kah)** dia punya mobil ?| Does he/she have a car?| you can use "apa" or "apakah"
|Dia punya **apa**?|**What** does he/she have?|  for these, you can only use "apa"
|Dia punya mobil **apa**?|**What kind of car** does he have?|  

:::tip Apa
In conclusion, use "apakah" or "apa" to form a yes/no question. But only use "Apa" for the question word "what"
:::

To ask **"which"** we use **"yang mana"** preceded by the noun. For example "Which car?" becomes
**"mobil yang mana?"**. It can be abbreviated to **"mobil mana?"**

|ID          |EN            |note|
|----------------|-------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Mobil **yang mana**?|**Which** car?| 
|Mobil **mana** ?|**Which** car?| 

However to ask something like "which car do you want to buy?" it becomes 

> Mobil yang mana yang mau kamu beli?
> alternatively
> Mobil manakah yang mau kamu beli?
